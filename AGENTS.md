# Agent Development Rules

## Verification (Required on Every Code Change)

After any code change, run:

```bash
make lintfix && make lint && make test
```

All three must pass before the task is considered complete.

## Additional Linting

- **Shell scripts** (`.sh` files): must pass `shellcheck`. Covered by `make lint` automatically.
- **Dockerfile**: must pass `hadolint`. Covered by `make lint` automatically.

## Configuration

- Never use `os.getenv` directly in application code.
- All configuration must be accessed via `from config import settings` (see `app/config.py`).
- Never commit `.env` files. Use `.env.example` as the documentation template.

## Code Style

- Python 3.12+ with strict mypy typing
- Line length: 100 characters (enforced by ruff and pylint)
- Formatting: ruff (run `make lintfix` to auto-apply)

## Architecture Reference

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for module responsibilities, SQLite schema, configuration
schema, and the discount threshold formula.

## Git Workflow

**Never push directly to `master`.** Every change, no matter how small, must go through
a pull request. This is a hard requirement, not a preference.

### Opening a PR

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
2. Commit changes on that branch
3. Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
4. Open a PR with `gh pr create`

PRs are squash-merged only. The repository owner is `@jasmeralia` (see `.github/CODEOWNERS`).

### After a PR is merged

1. Switch back to master and pull: `git checkout master && git pull`
2. Watch the GitHub Actions run on `master` complete successfully before reporting the
   task done. Use `gh run watch $(gh run list --branch master --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')` to stream it live, confirming the release workflow (tag creation and Docker image push to GHCR) finishes without error.
